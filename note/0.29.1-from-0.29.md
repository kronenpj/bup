Notable changes in 0.29.1 as compared to 0.29
=============================================

May require attention
---------------------

* Running gc with a --threshold of 0 no longer runs the risk of
  corrupting the repository.  (The default threshold is 10).
  Previously, gc could delete a packfile after rewriting it when the
  packfile didn't change.

Build system
------------

* The `bup rm` tests should be less sensitive to variations in rsync's
  output.

* The `bup ls` tests should work on current Cygwin64.

Thanks to (at least)
